# Whoop Recovery Score Prediction Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting fatigue based on resting heart rate (RHR) data collected over 10 consecutive months. The dataset is part of a personal fitness analysis using data from the Whoop fitness tracker. By analyzing the resting heart rate data, the goal is to develop a model that can predict fatigue levels, helping to optimize rest and performance.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of resting heart rate (RHR) values recorded daily over a 10-month period. This data is crucial for identifying patterns related to physical exertion, recovery, and overall health. The dataset includes:

- Date of each measurement
- Resting heart rate (bpm)
- Calculated daily fatigue level (based on the RHR values)

## Objectives

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Cleaning and processing the raw RHR data to ensure it is ready for analysis and modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the trends and distributions of RHR over time to uncover patterns and anomalies.
- **Fatigue Prediction Model**: Developing a machine learning model to predict fatigue levels based on RHR data.
- **Insights**: Deriving actionable insights on how RHR can correlate with recovery and fatigue, and providing recommendations for optimal rest periods.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Primary language for data analysis, cleaning, and modeling.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization libraries for EDA.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Used for documenting the analysis process and visualizing results.
