# Whoop Recovery Score Prediction Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting fatigue based on resting heart rate (RHR) data collected over 10 consecutive months. The dataset is part of a personal fitness analysis using data from the Whoop fitness tracker. By analyzing the RHR data, the goal is to develop a model that can predict fatigue levels, helping to optimize rest and performance.

## Dataset

The dataset includes daily RHR measurements spanning 10 months, providing valuable insights into recovery and fatigue patterns. Key features in the dataset are:

- **Date**: The date of each measurement.
- **Resting Heart Rate (RHR)**: Measured in beats per minute (bpm).
- **Sleep Debt**: The difference between actual and required sleep.
- **Recovery Score**: An overall measure of physical recovery.

## Project Workflow

### **1. Data Cleaning and Preparation**

- Removed any missing or duplicate values from the dataset.
- Converted date values to a consistent datetime format for easier analysis.
- Normalized numerical columns for better compatibility with machine learning models.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
